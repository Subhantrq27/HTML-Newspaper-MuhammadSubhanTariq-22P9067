## Project Description
This project is a recreation of the historic Daily Jang front page from the 1965 war. The main focus was to capture the intensity of the "War Begins" headline and the critical news about the air battles. I translated the Urdu content into English while maintaining the visual hierarchy of the original layout using only HTML (no external CSS/JS).

## Features Implemented
- **Semantic HTML5:** Used `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better document structure.
- **Table Layout:** Used a 2-column table structure to mimic the newspaper's vertical columns because external CSS was forbidden.
- **Typography Hierarchy:** Used `<h1>` (font-weight 900) for the main war headline and `<h2>` for the "22 Jets" highlight to draw attention.
- **List Styling:** Implemented an unordered list `<ul>` to summarize key war updates regarding the Lahore sector.

## Challenges Faced
One major challenge was aligning the "22 Indian Jets" highlight directly under the main headline while keeping the spacing correct. I solved this by using a `<div>` with a specific background color (`#eee`) and a bottom border right inside the main header section, ensuring it stood out just like in the original newspaper.
